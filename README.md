# MatrixFrame

Wemos d1 mini and 16x16 led matrix based Gif player

All of this software at this stage is made for a 16x16, so I highly reccomend you only use it with said pannel.\
To configure pannel settings head to include\displayFunctions.h and change settings to your need

### Road Map

- [x] Display gifs from FileSystem
- [ ] Create Web interface
- [ ] Save settings and state to filesystem
